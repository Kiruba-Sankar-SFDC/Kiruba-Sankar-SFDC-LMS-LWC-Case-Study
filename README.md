#LMS- Case Study.

1) For this case study, you're required to develop two Lightning Web Components (LWC): one for creating contacts and another for displaying a list of contacts in a lightning-datatable.
  
2) Utilize the lightning-record-edit-form component to facilitate contact creation. Upon successful creation, display a success toast message and publish an event to the Lightning Message Service (LMS).

3 )The second component should automatically refresh itself upon receiving a signal from the first component. Consider using refreshApex to refresh the data without reloading the entire page.
